# Templates

Templates that I use in my own projects.

## Usage

You can use these templates in two ways:

- By copy-pasting these templates to your repository and changing the filenames.

- By writing a simple CLI tool that automates the process of copy-pasting and renaming.

I've chosen the second approach. There is a couple of Zsh functions in [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/kirillgashkov/dotfiles) capable of using these templates.
